# AgarosePlateStamper
This project is a tool for immobilising bacterial cells at the bottom of plates for high content microscopy which consists of a plate stamp, a centering frame, an agarose mould and a cutter. To make it viable, it has to be able to transfer an agarose pad, loaded with bacteria, to the bottom of a 96 well plate.
