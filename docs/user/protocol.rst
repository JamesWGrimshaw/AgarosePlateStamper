Using the Agarose Plate Stamper
===============================

.. _model_selection:

Selecting your models
----------------------

First, select the appropriate models for your plate. The models are stored in the `stls` directory and are within
subdirectories that correspond to the plate type. For example, the models for the ibidi 96 well plate with round wells are 
stored in the `ibidi Âµ-Plate 96 Well Round` directory. Each plate should include the following models:

- `plate.stl`: An example of the plate itself generated by the software.
- `mould.stl`: A mould that is used to cast the agarose pads that will be loaded and placed into the wells.
- `stamp.stl`: The stamp that will be used to drive the agarose pads into the wells.

In addition, the folder will contain the manufactuer supplied technical drawings for the plate. These are used to generate the models
and are useful for checking the dimensions of the plate and if it is compatible for your particular plate type. If there are multiple 
plates compatible with this model, there will also be a text file containing all known compatible plates (if any are missed please
let us know by raising an issue on the GitHub repository).

If none of the already generated plates are compatible, please see the `Generating your own models` section for how to 
create custom models for your particular plate type.

.. _model_printing:

Printing your models
---------------------

Once you have selected the appropriate models for your plate, you can print them using a 3D printer. Initial testing was performed
using a Prusa i3 MK3S+ with a 0.4 mm nozzle and Prusament PLA filament. The models were printed with a 0.2 mm layer height and 20% infill,
with a solid infill threshold area greater than the area of one of your wells (e.g. used 15 mm^2 for the ibidi 96 well plate). This is to 
ensure that the strength of the columns which can break without this infill setting.

However, these models should be compatible with any 3D printing format so please try and share your results!
